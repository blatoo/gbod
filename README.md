# Grid Based Anomaly Detection (GBOD)
GBOD is an algorithm developed for anomaly detection for large datasets, it is extremely faster than the clustering and distanced based anomaly detection algorithms. It can also easily be implemented by mapreduce.

`OutlierDetection.py`: GBOD python source file
`OutlierDetection_GBOD_Usage.ipynb`: Detailed usage example with jupyter notebook
`OutlierDetection_GBOD_Usage.html`: Detailed usage example with html

**Notice: Under work...**
The Spark and Flink implementation will be added later.
